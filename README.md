# Common Steps:

# Activate Cloud Shell

1. Click the Activate Cloud Shell icon at the top of the Google Cloud console.
2. When you are connected, you are already authenticated, and the project is set to your PROJECT_ID. The output contains a line that declares the PROJECT_ID for this session:

` 
Your Cloud Platform project in this session is set to YOUR_PROJECT_ID
`

3. gcloud is the command-line tool for Google Cloud. It comes pre-installed on Cloud Shell and supports tab-completion.

`
You can list the active account name with this command:
gcloud auth list
`

4. Click Authorize.

5. Your output should now look like this

`
ACTIVE: *
ACCOUNT: student-01-xxxxxxxxxxxx@qwiklabs.net
To set up the active account, run:
    $ gcloud config set account ACCOUNT
`
